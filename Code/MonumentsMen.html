            <h2>Who were the Monuments Men (and woman)?</h2>
            <p>The Monuments Men were a group of art experts, including curators, historians, architects, and artists, who worked to protect and recover cultural treasures during and after the Second World War. Their official name was the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) program. This group also included one woman, Rose Valland, who played a major role in tracking stolen art (Smithsonian Magazine).</p>

            <h2>What was their role in the Second World War?</h2>
            <p>The Monuments Men were tasked with finding, protecting, and returning important artworks and cultural monuments stolen or damaged during the war. They risked their lives on the frontlines to ensure that famous pieces of art and historic buildings were saved from destruction or theft by the Nazis (Edsel and Witter).</p>

            <h2>Why did Hitler want to capture European art and cultural treasures?</h2>
            <p>Hitler wanted to collect European art and cultural treasures to display in a massive museum called the Führermuseum. He saw art as a symbol of power and culture and believed it would help demonstrate the superiority of the Nazi regime. By stealing these treasures, he also aimed to erase the cultural identity of the nations he invaded (Kennedy).</p>

        <h1>Were the Monuments Men a Necessary Part of the Anti-War Effort?</h1>
        <p>Yes, the Monuments Men were an important part of the anti-war effort. They worked hard to save humanity’s shared history and culture. Without them, many priceless artworks and historic buildings could have been destroyed or lost forever. Their work showed that even during war, it is important to protect art and culture for future generations. By recovering stolen art and stopping further damage, the Monuments Men helped to keep these treasures safe (History.com Editors).</p>

                <h3>Lady with an Ermine</h3>
                <p>The Lady with an Ermine is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. It is a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, who was the mistress of Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan. The Nazis stole this artwork during World War II from Poland. It was taken as part of Hitler's plan to gather cultural treasures for his envisioned museum. The painting was recovered after the war and returned to Poland, where it is now displayed at the National Museum in Kraków (Edsel and Witter).</p> <br>

                <h3>The Ghent Altarpiece</h3>
                <p>The Ghent Altarpiece, also known as the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, was painted by Jan van Eyck. This massive, multi-panel piece was one of the most sought-after artworks during World War II. The Nazis stole it and hid it in a salt mine in Altaussee, Austria, along with many other cultural treasures. The Monuments Men eventually recovered the altarpiece, and it was returned to its original location at Saint Bavo Cathedral in Belgium (Smithsonian Magazine).</p><br>

            <h2>Was all the artwork retrieved after the war?</h2>
            <p>No, not all the artwork was retrieved. While the Monuments Men recovered thousands of pieces, many are still missing today. Some were destroyed during the war, while others remain hidden in private collections or have yet to be rediscovered (Edsel and Witter).</p>
